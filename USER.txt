You can also run the rust daemon as a user own process.
This means, that the user itself is able to start/stop the instance without sudo rights.

Usually user services are started during the first login and stopped when
then last session closes. To prevent this, make the user session available during bootup


  # su 
  # loginctl enable-linger rust
  # exit

Create a copy of the service file and adjust it with your script name,
also remove the user & group parameter and change the Wanted By Target:

  # cp rust.service rustmyserver.service
  # sed -i -e 's|User=rust||' -e 's|Group=rust||'   rustmyserver.service 
  # sed -i -e 's|multi-user.target|default.target|' rustmyserver.service
  # nano rustmyserver.service

Copy the service file to the systemd user folder:

  # mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/ 
  # cp rustmyserver.service ~/.config/systemd/user/

To enable the Userservice rustmyserver.service for startup run:

  # systemctl --user enable rustmyserver.service

To start/stop it use:

  # systemctl --user start rustmyserver.service
